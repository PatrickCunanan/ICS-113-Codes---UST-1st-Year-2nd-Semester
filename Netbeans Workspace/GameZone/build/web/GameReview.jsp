                <td width = 85%>If the first Dark Souls depicted a world gracefully drifting towards the apocalypse, Dark Souls 3 shows one on a spiraling, feverish descent directly into it. It’s a fierce and punishing behemoth that dares you to take a step forward before knocking you back, again and again and again. But with a bleak, yet beautiful world that’s enthralling to explore and packed with secrets to find, I always felt compelled to come back, eager for that familiar thrill of overcoming even the most exacting challenges. 
                    Dark Souls 3 does suffer from occasional framerate dips and a few underwhelming boss fights, but beyond that, its epic scale, aggressive obstacles, and rich development of existing lore make it the grandest and fiercest Dark Souls adventure yet.</td>

                <td>In amongst its frantic combat, slick parkour, and outrageous action choreography, Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End achieves something wonderful: maturity. This is less a breezy lad’s tale revelling in fortune and glory and more a story about the lads when they’re all grown up, bolstered by an equally developed graphics engine and career-high performances from its cast. A surprisingly assured set of multiplayer modes ices the cake.
What lets it down, however, is an uninspired and overly long third act which slows down its pace considerably with curiously repetitive gameplay. Uncharted 4 consequently falls short of the greatness achieved by some of developer Naughty Dog’s leaner, more inventive predecessors.</td>

                <td><img src="ReviewPage/DOOM.jpg" height="200"></td>
                <td>At its best, Doom is everything it should be: a single-player campaign that’s just you, your super shotgun, and barely the amount of ammunition required to kill every single demon on Mars. It feels like a Doom game as you desperately try to find health pickups to keep you going, an ever-growing menagerie of demons snapping at your heels. It's exhausting and exciting and a little bit dumb, and when you're into it you're all the way in. At its worst, Doom is a repetitive series of enclosed rooms filled with demons, all of which you must kill to advance, complemented by a derivative and poorly thought-out multiplayer mode.
First impressions wise, Doom strikes all the right notes. The Union Aerospace Corporation's research facility on Mars runs red with the blood of employees who’ve learned a new meaning for the phrase 'wrongful termination,' but that barely matters to the inexplicably mute Doomguy, who shoots anything and everything which moves. Starting with only the pistol encourages you to focus on the diabolically delightful Glory Kill system — shoot your nearest Demon enough that they become staggered and highlighted in blue or orange, and if you press F (or R3 on a PS4 controller) while standing next to them you will rend them asunder. That is to say, you'll tear off their limbs and, in more than a few cases, joyfully beat them with their own appendages.</td>

                <td><img src="ReviewPage/Battleborn.jpg" height="200"></td>
                <td>Battleborn is one of the most chaotic shooters I've ever played, and true to form it managed to frustrate and amaze me at the same time. The single-player and co-op campaign hinges on a threadbare story, propelled by forgettable NPCs flailing with non-stop hit-or-miss jokes. The multiplayer attempts to fuse genres by mixing in MOBA mechanics and is sometimes successful, but also misses out on sorely needed online staples. And the entire package is led by a cast that constantly piques my curiosity due to the brilliant in-match leveling system.
Each of Battleborn's two dozen characters has a fun look that creates an instant attraction, and the variety of their abilities digs the claws in deeper. After dipping my toe in with the standard soldier Oscar Mike, the literally lumbering Montana made for a natural progression. Before you know it, I was moving onto stranger selections like the melee-focused human-demon hybrid Shayne & Aurox. What gives each of their ability sets depth and diversity beyond the initial character choice is that you begin every new excursion at level one and progress through 10 upgrade choices in the course of a single session, with the twist that you have to choose the upgrades on the fly, like in a MOBA.</td>
